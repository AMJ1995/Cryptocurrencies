# Project Summary

One of my clients, Martha, who is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountablity Accounting has asked me to help her with a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for her company's customers. I've used my coding knowledge to help create a report that includes all of the cryptocurrencies which are on the trading market and I've grouped them to create a classification system.
I used an unsupervised learning clustering algorithm to help me accomplish this goal, and I've also created a few visualizations.
For my first deliverable, I preprocessed the data for PCA. In the second deliverable, I reduced the data dimensions using PCA. Next, I clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-Means. For the final deliverable, I created visualizations for the cryptocurrency results.
